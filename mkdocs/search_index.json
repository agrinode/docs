It is designed for connections to remote locations where a \"small code footprint\" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker. The broker is responsible for distributing messages to interested clients based on the topic of a message. Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link Solutions authored the first version of the protocol in 1999 \n[1]\n. \n\n\nIn this demo, I work on Mosquitto platform (An Open source MQTT v3.1/v3.1.1 Broker)\n\n\nThe picture shows the basic MQTT protocol. MQTT broker - Mosquitto is installed into a Gateway - \nKura based\n (Hardware: Raspberry Pi 2; OS: Raspbian). The clients - Publisher/Subscriber connect to MQTT broker via WiFi which is established by the PC. The Subscriber is an Arduino board with WiFi module that subscribes a Topic (for example \"Node01\") to receive a message. The Publisher is a smartphone running MQTT client software that will publish a message to a topic (for example \"Node01\").\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nHardwares: Raspberry Pi 2 (WiFi dongle); Arduino with WiFi module (Adafruit Huzzah Esp8266); Smartphone (Android, IOS)\n\n\n\n\n* Step 1: Setup Kura into Raspberry Pi\n\n\nFollow this link for installing Kura into Raspberry Pi: \nhttp://eclipse.github.io/kura/doc/raspberry-pi-quick-start.html\n\n\nWe setup the Raspbery Pi in the Access Point mode for providing WiFi connection:\n\n\n\n\n* Step 2: Install Mosquitto broker into Raspberry Pi\n\n\nWe use Mosquitto platform as a MQTT broker running on Rapsberry Pi. It provides MQTT protocol for our sensor network system. For more information about MQTT protocol; please visit this page: \nwhat is MQTT and how does it work\n\n\nTo install Mosquitto, follow these steps:\n\n\nwget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\n\n\nsudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\n\n\nThen make the repository available to apt:\n\n\ncd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\n\n\nThen one of the following, depending on which version of debian you are using:\n\n\nsudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-wheezy.list\nsudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-jessie.list\n\n\nThen update apt information:\n\n\napt-get update\n\n\nAnd discover what mosquitto packages are available:\n\n\napt-cache search mosquitto\n\n\nOr just install:\n\n\napt-get install mosquitto\n\n\nFor more information, please follow this link: \nhttp://mosquitto.org/2013/01/mosquitto-debian-repository/\n\n\n* Step 3: Install MQTT demo code for Arduino\n\n\nThere are many MQTT libraries for Arduino platform. For this demo, I use MQTT library created by Joel Gahwiler \n(available in Github)\n\n\nIt is installed into Ardafruit Huzzah Esp8266 board.\n\n\nIn the sketch, we need to define these parameters:\n\n\n\"firstly, we need to connect Arduino Huzzah to the Gateway via WiFi connection which is established by the Gateway\"\n\n\nssid = \"YOUR_WIFI_NAME\"\n   //WiFi connection established from the Gateway\n\n\npass = \"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\"\n \n\n\nThen replace \n\"broker.shiftr.io\"\n by \n172.16.1.1\n for MQTT broker\n\n\nFinally, define subscribe topic \nclient.subscribe(\"node01\");\n for receiving message payload from the publisher.\n\n\n* Step 4: Install MQTT client software for Android phone\n\n\nThere are many softwares available for MQTT protocol testing. I use \nMyMQTT\n for my Android phone.\n\n\n\n\nFor \"Setting\": we need MQTT broker host (it is the Gateway IP: \n172.16.1.1:1883\n) and \"Topic\" for publishing message (it is: \nNode01\n).\n\n\nFor publishing a message: navigate to \"Publish\" button -\n then fill in the Topic (\nNode01\n) and message.\n\n\nRefferences\n\n\n[1] \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT",
