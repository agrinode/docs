It is designed for connections to remote locations where a \"small code footprint\" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker. The broker is responsible for distributing messages to interested clients based on the topic of a message. Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link Solutions authored the first version of the protocol in 1999 \n[1]\n. \n\n\nIn this demo, I work on Mosquitto platform (An Open source MQTT v3.1/v3.1.1 Broker)\n\n\nThe picture shows the basic MQTT protocol. MQTT broker - Mosquitto is installed into a Gateway - \nKura based\n (Hardware: Raspberry Pi 2; OS: Raspbian). The clients - Publisher/Subscriber connect to MQTT broker via WiFi which is established by the PC. The Subscriber is an Arduino board with WiFi module that subscribes a Topic (for example \"Node01\") to receive a message. The Publisher is a smartphone running MQTT client software that will publish a message to a topic (for example \"Node01\").\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nHardwares: Raspberry Pi 2 (WiFi dongle); Arduino with WiFi module (Adafruit Huzzah Esp8266); Smartphone (Android, IOS)\n\n\n\n\n* Step 1: Setup Kura into Raspberry Pi\n\n\nThe picture shows the Gateway hardware which consists of Raspberry Pi and WiFi dongle.\n\n\n\n\nFollow this link for installing Kura into Raspberry Pi: \nhttp://eclipse.github.io/kura/doc/raspberry-pi-quick-start.html\n\n\nWe setup the Raspbery Pi in the Access Point mode for providing WiFi connection:\n\n\n\n\n* Step 2: Install Mosquitto broker on Raspberry Pi\n\n\nWe use Mosquitto platform as a MQTT broker running on Rapsberry Pi. It provides MQTT protocol for our sensor network system. For more information about MQTT protocol; please visit this page: \nwhat is MQTT and how does it work\n\n\nTo install Mosquitto, follow these steps:\n\n\nwget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\n\n\nsudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\n\n\nThen make the repository available to apt:\n\n\ncd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\n\n\nThen one of the following, depending on which version of debian you are using:\n\n\nsudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-jessie.list\n\n\nThen update apt information:\n\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nAnd discover what mosquitto packages are available:\n\n\napt-cache search mosquitto\n\n\nOr just install mosquitto broker and clients tool:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients python-mosquitto\n\n\nFor more information, please follow this link: \nhttp://mosquitto.org/2013/01/mosquitto-debian-repository/\n\n\n* Test mosquitto broker\n\n\nOpen up two more terminal windows.\n\n\nIn Terminal window (subscriber) 1 type:\n\n\nmosquitto_sub -d -t hello/world\n\n\nIn Terminal window 2 (publisher) type:\n\n\nmosquitto_pub -d -t hello/world -m \"Hello from Terminal window 2!\"\n\n\nResult:\n\n\n* Step 3: Install MQTT demo code for Arduino\n\n\nThe Huzzah esp8266 board will receive the message from the phone in order to control a LED (connected to pin #0). The LED will be turned off if Huzzah receives message \"a\" and turn on with others messages.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many MQTT libraries for Arduino platform. For this demo, I use MQTT library created by Joel Gahwiler \n(available in Github)\n\n\nIt is installed into Ardafruit Huzzah Esp8266 board.\n\n\nIn the sketch, we need to define these parameters:\n\n\n\"firstly, we need to connect Arduino Huzzah to the Gateway via WiFi connection which is established by the Gateway\"\n\n\nssid = \"YOUR_WIFI_NAME\"\n   //WiFi connection established from the Gateway\n\n\npass = \"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\"\n \n\n\nThen replace \n\"broker.shiftr.io\"\n by \n172.16.1.1\n for MQTT broker\n\n\nFinally, define subscribe topic \nclient.subscribe(\"node01\");\n for receiving message payload from the publisher.\n\n\nFull code here:\n\n\n#include \nESP8266WiFi.h\n\n\n#include \nMQTTClient.h\n\n\nconst char *ssid = \nagrinode\n;\n\nconst char *pass = \n12345678\n;\n\nWiFiClient net;\n\nMQTTClient client;\n\nunsigned long lastMillis = 0;\n\nvoid connect(); // \n- predefine connect() for setup()\n\nvoid setup() {\n\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n\n  WiFi.begin(ssid, pass);\n\n  client.begin(\n172.16.1.1\n, net);\n\n  pinMode(0,OUTPUT);\n\n  connect();\n\n}\n\nvoid connect() {\n\n ` Serial.print(\nchecking wifi...\n);\n\n` while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {`\n\n `   Serial.print(\n.\n);`\n\n  `  delay(1000);`\n\n ` }`\n\n ` Serial.print(\n\\nconnecting...\n);`\n\n  `while (!client.connect(\narduino\n, \ntry\n, \ntry\n)) {`\n\n  `  Serial.print(\n.\n);`\n\n   ` delay(1000);`\n\n ` }`\n\n  `Serial.println(\n\\nconnected!\n);`\n\n ` client.subscribe(\nnode01\n);`\n\n  `// client.unsubscribe(\n/example\n);`\n\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n\n  client.loop();\n\n  delay(10); // \n- fixes some issues with WiFi stability\n\n  if(!client.connected()) {\n\n    connect();\n\n  }\n\n  // publish a message roughly every second.\n\n  if(millis() - lastMillis \n 1000) {\n\n   lastMillis = millis();\n\n    client.publish(\n/hello\n, \nworld\n);\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nvoid messageReceived(String topic, String payload, char * bytes, unsigned int length) {\n\n  Serial.print(\nincoming: \n);\n\n  Serial.print(topic);\n\n  Serial.print(\n - \n);\n\n  Serial.print(payload);\n\n  Serial.println();\n\n  if (payload==\na\n){digitalWrite(0,HIGH);}\n\n  else digitalWrite(0,LOW);\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n* Step 4: Install MQTT client software for Android phone\n\n\nThere are many softwares available for MQTT protocol testing. I use \nMyMQTT\n for my Android phone.\n\n\n\n\nFor \"Setting\": we need MQTT broker host (it is the Gateway IP: \n172.16.1.1:1883\n) and \"Topic\" for publishing message (it is: \nNode01\n).\n\n\nFor publishing a message: navigate to \"Publish\" button -\n then fill in the Topic (\nNode01\n) and message.\n\n\n* Demo Video\n\n\n\n\n\nRefferences\n\n\n[1] \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT",

Each Reactive Block is designed for a specific purpose such as connecting to Cloud platform (IBM Watson IoT, Xively,...), providing MQTT protocol, LoRaWAN interface,...\nReactive Blocks is a Plugin for Eclipse, which provides a development environment for a developer build a complex application by drag and drop reactive blocks from the Reactive Blocks libraries.\nFor me, I have a very basic knowledge of Java but I can build a complex java application with Reactive Blocks. Each block has a description in the form of input and output pins and contract. In addition, Reactive Blocks provides the analyze and animation tools which are helpful for testing the applications.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nBlock by Block Towards IoT Applications\nIntegrating Reactive Block with JamaicaVM\n\n\nAbout \"AgriNode bundle\".\n\n\nIn this post, I share the workflow of \"AgriNode\" bundle that will be installed into Eclipse Kura based gateway. The gateway has MQTT server which sensor nodes connect to.\nThe bundle purpose is to send a command for getting data to sensor nodes via MQTT (with a gateway server: 172.16.1.1:1883). After receiving the command from the gateway, sensor nodes take sensors reading then send data back to the gateway.
